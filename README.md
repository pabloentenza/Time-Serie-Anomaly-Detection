In this case, we obtain the dataset through the API of Kaggle and train different clasification algorithms for the detection of incidents. The metric used here is the recall because it is the metric that indicates the actually anomaly detection over all positive cases. Another problem is the imbalanced data. To solve this problem we use the SMOTE technique.
